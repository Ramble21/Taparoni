Simple chess engine made from the ground up completely by me, for fun. WIP, not complete yet

More information about the model: <br>
- Uses a custom-built Transformer to analyze positions, using Stockfish evaluations as references to train the model
- Trained on public data from https://database.lichess.org/ 
- Training loss of 0.097 and dev loss of 0.215 after training on a Radeon 6600XT for about 15 minutes (loss is calculated via Mean Absolute Error / L1 loss)

More capabilities coming soon <br>
